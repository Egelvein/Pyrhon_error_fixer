The user's `for` loop is incomplete; it lacks the colon that signifies the start of the code block to be executed in each iteration.  Example 1 demonstrates the correct syntax for a `for` loop in Python.\n\nCorrected Code:\n\n```python\nfor i in range(5):\n    pass # Add a placeholder or your intended code here.\n```\n\nThe `pass` statement is a placeholder.  The user needs to add the code they intend to execute within the loop.  Without knowing what the user intends the loop to do, `pass` prevents a `IndentationError`.\n"

The user's `for` loop lacks a colon at the end, which is syntactically required in Python to indicate the start of a code block.  Example 1 demonstrates this exact error and its correction.\n\n\n2. **Corrected Code:**\n\n```python\nfor i in range(5):\n    print(i)\n```\n\nThe corrected code simply adds a colon (`:`) after `range(5)`.  This tells the Python interpreter that the following indented line(s) belong to the `for` loop.  Without the colon, the interpreter throws a `SyntaxError`.\n"
